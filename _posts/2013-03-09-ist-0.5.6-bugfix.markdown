title: ist.js v0.5.6 released
---

I have just pushed ist.js version 0.5.6 to GitHub.  This version fixes a bug
that prevented building (with r.js) projects when using the `ist!` requirejs
plugin syntax. 

I'm sorry for the lack of updates lately; I'm currently working on ist.js v0.6,
which will allow updating rendered nodes with a new or modified context,
introduce some new built-in helpers and enhance performance.  I plan to add
JSDoc to the code and rewrite tests to be more thorough, better organized and so
that they can be automated (and hopefully get ist.js on a continuous integration
server).
