title: New website

Welcome to the new website for ist.js.  I'm still rounding the edges here, but overall it should be nearly fully functional.  Make sure to try the [online demo](online.html) !

Don't hesitate to contact me it you have any problems (with ist.js or with this website), on [twitter](http://twitter.com/njoyard) or using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/njoyard/ist/issues).

I'm also going to rewrite the documentation soon as it needs to be organized better.
