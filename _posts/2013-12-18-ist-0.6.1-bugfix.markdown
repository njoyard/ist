I just released ist.js 0.6.1, which fixes problems when building projects that
use `ist!path/to/template` dependencies with r.js.

Additionnaly, ist.js now uses [Karma][1] as a testing framework.  All tests have
been adapted to Karma and I added a bunch of new tests (including r.js build
tests).  Karma is a very nice framework, which is able to serve files on a
webserver and automatically launch web browsers (including PhantomJS for example)
to run test suites.  It also paves the way to setting up continuous integration
for ist.js.

Also, the download links on the home page have been fixed to point to the correct
path on github.
