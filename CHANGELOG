next version
- Fixed a bug where pushEvalVar would not hide a previously pushed variable
- Added new tests for push/popEvalVar behaviour
- Fixed a bug where rendering with context properties names that are not valid
  identifiers would cause an error
- Optimized rendering by reading context properties when the Context object is
  created, instead of doing it once for each "{{  }}" evaluation
- Template nodes now have a _getCode() method that outputs JS code to regenerate
  themselves 
- Templates loaded with the 'ist!' requirejs plugin are now pre-parsed.  This
  can be disabled by using the '!bare' suffix (eg. 'ist!templates/x!bare')
- Added a built-in '@eachkey' helper to loop over object own properties

v0.5.4 - 2012-11-19
- Added support for inline text nodes (text nodes specified on the same line
  as an element node: div.class "text child")

v0.5.3 - 2012-11-11
- Added partials
- Fixed error reporting (was buggy when evaluating code anywhere but in text
  nodes) and added new tests for it

v0.5.2 - 2012-10-20
- Rewrote build script using make
- Added support for standalone usage (without an AMD loader)

- Added fromScriptTag helper

v0.5.1 - 2012-07-20
- Added expression evaluation to {{...}} blocks and @directives

- Allowed implicit node creation (with qualifiers only; was working since 0.5
  but undocumented and untested)

v0.5 - 2012-07-12
- Full parser rewrite using PEGjs
- Reworked directory structure and added build script (can use uglify-js)
- New Context object, see README for API (mainly useful in directive helpers)
- Block helpers: parameters changed to account for new Context object
- Block helpers: named parameters are no longer supported (no use case)
- Block helpers: accept "direct" quoted string as parameter instead of context path
- Block helpers: allow returning undefined instead of an empty document fragment
- @each: added loop.length, loop.first and loop.last
- @each: fixed a bug when array items were arrays

- @each now treats all falsy values as an empty array
- Enabled access to loop index and outer context in @each directives

v0.4.1 - 2012-04-19
- Moved node creation outside compiler
- Added new single-node creation helper; can also create multiple nodes at once.

v0.4 - 2012-04-19
- Enabled template compilation with undefined block helpers (so they can be
  defined/registered just before rendering)
- Added named parameters support to block helpers
- Implemented @include directive
